          Classifiers Models with Artificial Neural
          Network Model for Fault Classification of
          a Gearbox</a>

          <p>Domain: <i>Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Network,Predictive Maintainence</i></p>


          <p style="font-size:14px;">This paper provides an insight into the comparison of the performance of the Machine
          Learning Models - Random Forrest Classifier,XGBoost and Artificial Neural Network
          model in predictive maintenance of a gearbox. A six-class gearbox fault dataset is used,
          consisting of healthy and faulty conditions, including missing tooth, eccentricity, root crack,
          surface crack, and chipped tooth. By applying FFT on the raw vibrational displacement data,
          frequency features are extracted. Random Forrest Classifier and Artificial Neural Network
          models are applied to those features to predict and classify gear faults.</p

                  -Decentralized Autonomous Mine Detection and Neutralization
</a>
<p>Domain: <i>Autonomous Drone,Robotics,Electronics</i></p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">    Landmines remain one of the deadliest remnants of past conflicts, causing thousands of casualties each year. Manual detection and disarmament of mines is a slow, dangerous, and resource-intensive process. To address this critical issue, we propose a Decentralized Autonomous Bot System that combines aerial surveillance with ground-based neutralization capabilities. This project leverages the synergy between a drone unit and a solar-powered ground unit to detect, locate, and safely disable landmines using smart technologies such as visual object detection.</p>
